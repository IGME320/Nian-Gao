//1) add comments to new code so everyone can quickly tell what it does
//2) name functions like this: ExampleFuntion()
//3) name variables like this: exampleVar
//4) explain your functions with comments, I don't care how simple they are, just do it
//this is all I have rn feel free to add more as they come up
